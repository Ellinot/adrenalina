# adrenalina

This code was written by [Matthew Stein](http://mstein.org/) as a [Fall 2015 Haskell student forum](http://cattheory.com/posts/2015-06-01-haskell-wesleyan.html) final project.

It is meant to generate a MIDI file that plays [this Balkan song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnakPaRndik) called "Adrenalina". ([This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkRjdB-MTZU) is a different take on the same song, but we didn't even know what the song was called at the time.)

# Usage

```
stack install
adrenalina music.midi
```
will create a MIDI file named `music.midi`.
